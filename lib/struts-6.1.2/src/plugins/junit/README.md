# Struts 2 JFreeChart plugin
The JUnit Plugin supports testing actions within a Struts invocation, meaning that a full request is simulated, 
and the output of the action can be tested.
You will find more details in [documentation](https://struts.apache.org/plugins/junit/).

## Installation
Just drop this plugin JAR into `WEB-INF/lib` folder or add it as a Maven dependency.
